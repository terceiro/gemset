gemset - manage different sets of Rubygems on your system
=========================================================

gemset is a simple replacement for RVM gemsets.

Usage
-----

Preparing the environment::

  $ gemset setup
  Now using gemset "default".

If you already have any gems installed, your current environment will be
made the "default" gemset::

  $ gemset setup
  Your current Rubygems environment was moved to a gemset named "default".
  Now using gemset "default".

Creating and using a gemset::

  $ gemset create rails3
  $ gemset use rails3
  Now using gemset "rails3".
  $ gem install rails3
  [...]
  $ gem list

`*` and printed in green)::

  $ gemset list
  * default
    empty
    noosfero
    rails3

Inspecting gemset capabilities::

  $ gemset  usage
  gemset - manage different sets of Rubygems on your system

  Usage:

    gemset list                lists the existing gemsets.
    gemset create [NAME]       creates a new gemset
    gemset remove [NAME]       removes an existing gemset
    gemset show [NAME]         shows the gems installed in a gemset
    gemset use [NAME]          change to using an existing gemset
    gemset help                displays usage information

Features
--------

* Works no matter which interactive shell you use: bash, zsh, csh, tcsh,
  fish etc, are all welcome.
* Works outside of interactive shells. For example, if you change your
  default gemset even GUI applications started without a shell will have
  access to that gemset you changed to. This can also be considered a
  bug.
* Works transparently both for the superuser (root), creating global
  gemsets, and for regular users, creting user-specific gemsets.
* Respects ``$GEM_HOME`` (will manage gemsets in ``$GEM_HOME/..``).
* Works with Bundler.

Limitations
-----------

* Does not deal with the issue of multiple ruby interpreters being
  installed. (although if you manage to change which interpreter is
  called by the ``ruby`` binary, it should work). If you want to manage
  different ruby interpreter installation, you should use RVM or
  something else instead.
